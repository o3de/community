# Community Membership

Welcome to the Open 3D Engine! To learn more about contributing to the [O3DE code repo](README.md), check out the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The [O3DE community repo](https://github.com/o3de/community) contains information about how to get started, how the community organizes, and more.

All contrubtors are required to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing to Open 3D Engine

Everyone is invited and welcome to contribute to Open 3D Engine. Some ways that you can contribute are by filing issues, pull requests, asking questions, participating in discussions and feature reviews, and engaging with _any_ public work. For authors of commits to products that are part of Open 3D Engine, you're required to ensure that your contribution is valid under the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://www.dita-ot.org/dco).

If you have a particular area of interest you'd like to contribute to, we maintain a list of our [Special Interest Groups](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started) (SIGs), community-driven organizations that guide the O3DE project. Each SIG holds meetings, discussion channels, maintains a mailing list,
and provides reviewers and maintainers for code and documentation. The best ways to contact a SIG are:

* [Discord](https://discord.gg/o3de)
* [SIG mailing lists](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started)
* [GitHub Discussions for O3DE](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/discussions)
* SIG meetings - an up-to-date list of meetings and times is on the [O3DE Calendar](https://lists.o3de.org/calendar)

## Reviewers 

A *Reviewer* is a role where a contributor is responsible for reviewing Pull Requests on GitHub and providing appropriate feedback. Reviewers are expected to be kind, courteous, and fair to submitters to any Open 3D Foundation project.

You must be nominated (self-nomination is allowed) for promotion from Contributor to Reviewer. To do this, an issue should be created on the SIG's repo for the supportive Reviewers and Maintainers to comment and add their support. For example, to nominate a reviewer on behalf of sig-content, an issue should be created in the [sig-content repository](https://github.com/o3de/sig-content/issues/new/choose).

Once you have the requisite support, the nomination issue needs to be reviewed and approved during a SIG meeting. If possible, the nominee should add the issue to the agenda for an upcoming SIG meeting and if possible attend the meeting. The SIG will then review and, if appropriate, approve. Nomination Issues that do not have the necessary support will be closed after 4 weeks of inactivity.


## Maintainers

A *Maintainer* role is an increased level of responsibility for a Reviewer. Maintainers aren't just responsible for performing review - they also have the ability to merge pull requests into the appropriate branch. Maintainers are high-quality Reviewers who take extra care when looking at a pull request, and are willing to trust the other Reviewers who approve work.

You must be nominated (self-nomination is allowed) for promotion from Reviewer to Maintainer. To do this, an issue should be created on the community repo for the supportive Maintainers to comment and add their support. Once you have the requisite support, the nomination Pull Request needs to be reviewed and approved during a SIG meeting.  The nominee should plan to attend and add it to the agenda for the SIG to review and, if appropriate, approve. Nomination Pull Requests that do not have the necessary support will be closed after 4 weeks of inactivity.

In order to ensure that nominees attend the appropriate SIG meeting, see the [O3DE Calendar](https://lists.o3de.org/calendar) for current meeting dates and times. The SIG maintainers or chairs are responsible for adding an item to the correct meeting agenda.

## Becoming a Reviewer or Maintainer

The SIGs maintain their own reviewer and maintainer standards, and have additional types of roles available in some cases. These standards are maintained in nomination issues, so each link goes to a "New Issue" form for nomination.
