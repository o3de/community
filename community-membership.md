# Community Membership

Welcome to the Open 3D Engine! To learn more about contributing to the [O3DE code repo](README.md), check out the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The [O3DE community repo](https://github.com/o3de/community) contains information about how to get started, how the community organizes, and more.

To contribute, please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first. 

## Contributing to Open 3D Engine

Everyone is invited and welcome to contribute to Open 3D Engine. Some ways that you can contribute are by filing issues, pull requests, asking questions, participating in discussions and feature reviews, and engaging with _any_ public work.

No official agreements are needed to participate in discussion, file issues, or ask and answer questions in the community. For authors of commits to products that are part of Open 3D Engine, you need to agree to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and ensure that your contribution is valid under the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://www.dita-ot.org/dco). 

If you have a particular area of interest you'd like to contribute to, we maintain a list of our [Special Interest Groups](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started) (SIGs), community-driven organizations that guide the O3DE project.

## Reviewers 

A *Reviewer* is a role where a contributor is responsible for reviewing Pull Requests on GitHub and providing appropriate feedback. Reviewers are expected to be kind, courteous, and fair to submitters to any Open 3D Foundation project. We have three types of Reviewers:

* *Code Reviewers*, responsible for reviewing source code submitted to repositories maintained by the Open 3D Foundation.
* *Documentation Reviewers*, responsible for reviewing items under the [Documentation & Community Special Interest Group charter](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community/blob/main/governance/charter.md).
* *Technical Reviewers*, code reviewers who also review documentation for technical accuracy.

You must be nominated (self-nomination is allowed) for promotion from Contributor to Reviewer. To do this, an issue should be created on the SIG's repo for the supportive Reviewers and Maintainers to comment and add their support. For example, to nominate a reviewer on behalf of sig-content, an issue should be created in the [sig-content repository](https://github.com/o3de/sig-content/issues/new/choose).

Once you have the requisite support, the nomination Issue needs to be reviewed and approved during a SIG meeting. If possible, the nominee should attend and add it to the agenda for the SIG to review and, if appropriate, approve. Nomination Issues that do not have the necessary support will be closed after 4 weeks of inactivity.

## Maintainers

A *Maintainer* role is an increased level of responsibility for a Reviewer. Maintainers aren't just responsible for performing review - they also have the ability to merge pull requests into the appropriate branch. Maintainers are high-quality Reviewers who take extra care when looking at a pull request, and are willing to trust the other Reviewers who approve work.

You must be nominated (self-nomination is allowed) for promotion from Reviewer to Maintainer. To do this, an issue should be created on the community repo for the supportive Maintainers to comment and add their support. Once you have the requisite support, the nomination Pull Request needs to be reviewed and approved during a SIG meeting.  The nominee should plan to attend and add it to the agenda for the SIG to review and, if appropriate, approve. Nomination Pull Requests that do not have the necessary support will be closed after 4 weeks of inactivity.

## Becoming a Reviewer or Maintainer

The SIGs maintain their own reviewer and maintainer standards, and have additional types of roles available in some cases. Maintainer standards are maintained in nomination issues, so each link goes to a "New Issue" form for nomination.
