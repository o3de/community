# Community Membership

Welcome to the Open 3D Engine! To learn more about contributing to the [O3DE code repo](README.md), check out the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The [O3DE community repo](https://github.com/o3de/community) contains information about how to get started, how the community organizes, and more.

To contribute, please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first. 

**NOTE:** These reviewer and maintainer roles are for the code repository, `o3de/o3de`. Roles on `o3de/o3de.org` have different requirements, and are maintained by the Documentation and Community Special Interest Group (D&C SIG). For information on the D&C SIG maintainer, reviewer, technical reviewer, and editor roles, read [SIG D&C Reviewer and Maintainer roles](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community/blob/main/governance/reviewers-maintainers.md).


## How to become a reviewer

Requirements to become a reviewer for a given Special Interest Group
* 6+ contributions successfully submitted to O3DE
* 100+ lines of code changed across all contributions submitted to O3DE
* 2+ O3DE Reviewers or Maintainers that support promotion from Contributor to Reviewer

You must be nominated (self-nomination is allowed) for promotion from Contributor to Reviewer.
To do this, an issue should be created on the SIG's repo for the supportive Reviewers and Maintainers to comment and add their support. For example, to nominate a reviewer on behalf of sig-content, an Issue should be created in the [sig-content repository](https://github.com/o3de/sig-content/issues/new/choose).

Once you have the requisite support, the nomination Issue needs to be reviewed and approved during a SIG meeting.  The nominee should plan to attend and add it to the agenda for the SIG to review and, if appropriate, approve.
Nomination Issues that do not have the necessary support will be closed after 4 weeks of inactivity.

Requirements to continue to be a Reviewer
* 4+ Pull Requests reviewed per month

If a Reviewer fails to meet the requirements, they will be given a 1 month grace period to get back to the required number of Pull Requests per month.  After the 2nd month, if they haven't returned to the required number of reviews, they will be returned to Contributor status.

You must be nominated (self-nomination is allowed) for promotion from Reviewer to Maintainer.
