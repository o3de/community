3.	Establish guidelines and rules: Alongside your server roadmap, it's important to establish guidelines and rules for member behavior and conduct. Guidelines and rules provide a framework for creating a safe, respectful, and engaging community, and help to prevent conflicts and disputes. Some examples of guidelines and rules might include prohibiting hate speech or harassment, establishing rules for posting content or sharing links, or outlining consequences for rule violations. <br>
4.	Communicate guidelines and rules to members: Once you have established guidelines and rules, it's important to communicate them clearly to your members. This can involve creating a server rules channel or section, where members can review and acknowledge the guidelines and rules. It's also important to enforce the rules consistently and fairly, and to address any violations promptly and respectfully. <br>
5.	Monitor and adapt your roadmap and guidelines: Finally, it's important to continuously monitor and adapt your server roadmap and guidelines to ensure that they are meeting the needs of your community. This can involve collecting feedback from members, analyzing server metrics, and testing new features and guidelines to see how they perform. By staying attuned to your members' needs and preferences, you can create a dynamic and engaging community that evolves over time. <br>

Overall, creating a server roadmap and establishing guidelines and rules are critical steps in setting up a successful Discord server. By defining your server's purpose and goals, identifying key milestones and timelines, establishing guidelines and rules, communicating them clearly to members, and monitoring and adapting them over time, you can create a community that is safe, engaging, and responsive to the needs of its members. <br>

How to set up server rules for a new Discord server: <br>

1.	Determine the rules you want to enforce: Before creating rules, it's important to determine the behavior you want to promote on your server and the behavior you want to prohibit. This will help you create rules that align with your server's goals and promote a healthy community. <br>
2.	Create a rules channel: To create a rules channel, go to your server settings menu and select "Channels." From there, click the plus sign next to the category you want to add the channel to, and then select "Create Channel." Give the channel a name (such as "Rules"), and set the channel type to "Text." You can also customize the channel's permissions so that only moderators or administrators can post in it. <br>
3.	Write your rules: Once you've created your rules channel, it's time to write your rules. Be clear and concise, and use language that's easy to understand. You may also want to include examples of behavior that's prohibited or encouraged. Discord's Community Guidelines are a good resource for creating rules that promote a healthy community. You can find the guidelines at https://discord.com/guidelines. <br>
4.	Pin your rules: After you've written your rules, it's important to make them easily accessible to your community members. One way to do this is by pinning your rules to your rules channel. To pin a message, hover over it and click the three dots that appear. From there, select "Pin Message." <br>
5.	Enforce your rules: Enforcing your rules is just as important as creating them. Be sure to have moderators or administrators who are responsible for enforcing the rules, and make sure that community members know how to report rule violations. You may also want to consider setting up a system of warnings or strikes for users who violate the rules. <br>

By taking the time to create and enforce rules that promote a healthy community, you can create a welcoming and safe space for your Discord server members. Remember to refer to Discord's Community Guidelines for inspiration and best practices. <br>

Creating additional rules for a Discord server can be an ongoing process as the community grows and evolves. Here are some steps to follow when creating additional rules: <br>

1.	Monitor the server: As your server grows, it's important to monitor the behavior of community members to identify any issues that arise. Keep an eye out for any patterns of negative behavior or rule violations. <br>
2.	Analyze the behavior: Once you've identified potential issues, analyze the behavior to determine what kind of rule may need to be put in place. For example, if members are spamming the server with memes or GIFs, you may want to create a rule limiting the number of memes or GIFs that can be posted per day. <br>
3.	Draft the new rule: Using the behavior analysis, draft a new rule that addresses the issue at hand. Be sure to make the rule clear and easy to understand. <br>
4.	Review the rule with moderators: Before implementing the new rule, review it with your server's moderators to ensure that it's fair, enforceable, and aligns with the server's overall goals. <br>
5.	Communicate the new rule: Once the new rule is finalized, communicate it to the community members in a clear and concise manner. You may want to announce the new rule in a server-wide announcement, pin it in the rules channel, or both. <br>
6.	Enforce the rule: Enforcing the new rule is just as important as communicating it. Make sure that moderators and administrators are aware of the new rule and prepared to enforce it. Additionally, make sure that community members know how to report rule violations and that there are consequences in place for violating the rules. <br>

By following these steps, you can create additional rules that address specific issues within your community and ensure that your Discord server remains a welcoming and safe space for all members.

4.	Customization and Branding <br>

### Choosing a server icon and background image

Choosing a server icon and background image are important steps in setting up a Discord server as they help to visually represent your community and create a professional appearance. Here are some tips for selecting a server icon and background image: <br>

1.	Keep it simple: When choosing a server icon and background image, it's important to keep it simple. A cluttered or overly complex image can be distracting and difficult to interpret. Choose an image that is easily recognizable and relates to the theme or purpose of your server. <br>
2.	Use high-quality images: Using high-quality images is important to ensure that your server looks professional and visually appealing. Use images that are clear and have high resolution, and avoid using images that are pixelated or blurry.
3.	Consider your branding: Your server icon and background image should align with your server's branding and identity. If you have a logo or color scheme, consider using them in your icon and background image to create a consistent look and feel. <br>
4.	Test for visibility: When choosing a server icon and background image, it's important to test them for visibility. Make sure that your icon and background image do not clash with your server's text or color scheme, and that they are visible on both desktop and mobile devices. <br>
5.	Keep it appropriate: Finally, when choosing a server icon and background image, it's important to keep it appropriate. Avoid using images that are offensive or controversial, as this can turn off potential members and create a negative reputation for your server. <br>
6.	Animated icons, also known as server animated icons, are a feature that is available to verified Discord servers. Verified servers are those that have been approved by Discord and have received a special badge. Animated icons allow you to add an extra level of customization and visual interest to your server, by adding a subtle animation to your server icon. <br>
To use an animated icon, you'll need to have a verified server and upload a GIF file as your server icon. The GIF can have up to 15 frames and should be optimized for size and performance. Once you've uploaded your animated icon, it will appear as a subtle animation in the server list and server header. <br>

Animated icons can be a great way to add personality and visual interest to your server, but it's important to use them judiciously. Avoid using animations that are too distracting or that clash with your server's branding or theme. It's also important to keep in mind that not all users will be able to see animated icons, especially those using older devices or slower internet connections. <br>

Overall, choosing a server icon and background image is an important step in creating a professional and visually appealing Discord server. By keeping it simple, using high-quality images, aligning with your branding, testing for visibility, and keeping it appropriate, you can create a server that reflects your community's identity and attracts new members.

Overall, customizing your roles and channels with colors and emojis is a great way to make your Discord server more unique and appealing to your members.

###  Creating custom welcome messages and announcements

Creating custom welcome messages and announcements is an important part of setting up a Discord server, as it helps to create a welcoming environment for new members and keep existing members informed and engaged. Here are some tips for creating custom welcome messages and announcements: <br>

To add a bot to your server, you will need to create an application on the Discord Developer Portal and then invite the bot to your server using its unique OAuth2 URL. Once the bot is added, you can configure its settings and commands using the bot's dashboard or command interface. Many bots also offer additional features and integrations that can be enabled by connecting to external services or APIs. It is important to ensure that any bots you add to your server are reputable, secure, and comply with Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

### Integrating third-party services like YouTube, Twitter, and GitHub 

Integrating third-party services like YouTube, Twitter, and GitHub can add value to your Discord server and enhance the user experience. For example, by integrating YouTube, you can notify your community when you upload a new video to your channel, and your community can watch it together and discuss it in real-time on Discord. Similarly, by integrating Twitter, you can keep your community updated on your latest tweets and engage with them directly on Discord. And if you're managing an open-source project, integrating GitHub can help you manage your community's contributions and track issues and pull requests. <br>

Discord offers a range of third-party integrations through its "integrations" menu in server settings. To integrate a third-party service, simply select the integration you want to use, authorize Discord to access your account, and configure the integration settings to your liking. Keep in mind that some integrations may require a subscription or additional fees, so make sure to review the pricing before enabling an integration. <br>

How to integrate GitHub with your Discord server: <br>

1.	First, you'll need to create a webhook in your GitHub repository. To do this, go to the "Settings" tab in your repository and click on "Webhooks". <br>
2.	Click on the "Add webhook" button, and then fill in the details for the webhook. In the "Payload URL" field, paste the webhook URL for your Discord server. <br>
3.	Under "Content type", select "application/json". Then, choose the events that you want to trigger the webhook. For example, you may want to trigger the webhook when someone creates a new issue or pull request. <br>
4.	Click on "Add webhook" to create the webhook. Now, whenever the events you selected are triggered, GitHub will send a notification to your Discord server. <br>
5.	In your Discord server, you can use a bot like "GitHub Webhook" to receive and display the notifications. To add the bot, go to the "Server Settings" and then "Integrations". Search for "GitHub Webhook" and click on "Add". <br>
6.	Follow the prompts to authorize the bot to access your Discord server. Once authorized, the bot will automatically display notifications from GitHub in a designated channel. <br>

Now, your Discord community can stay up-to-date with the latest activity from your GitHub repository.

## Promotion and Growth

### Inviting members and promoting the server on social media and other platforms

One way to encourage growth and engagement within a Discord community is to invite new members and promote the server on social media and other platforms. This can be done by creating promotional graphics or videos to share on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or Reddit. Additionally, reaching out to other communities or influencers in your niche can help spread the word about your server. It's important to have a clear message or value proposition when promoting the server, as well as clear guidelines for new members to follow. It's also a good idea to have a system in place to handle new member introductions and ensure they feel welcome in the community. Overall, promoting the server on various platforms and inviting new members can help grow the community and bring in fresh perspectives and ideas. <br>

Promoting the Discord server on official websites and social media can also be a great way to reach out to potential members and increase community engagement. For example, if you're running a gaming community, you could post about the Discord server on gaming forums or on the official social media pages of the game. If you're running a business or organization, you could post about the Discord server on your official website or social media accounts. It's important to make sure that your promotional content is clear and concise, and highlights the benefits and features of the Discord server. Additionally, it's a good idea to engage with potential members and respond to any questions or feedback they may have about the server. By utilizing various promotional channels and engaging with potential members, you can help grow and strengthen your Discord community.

### Encouraging member participation and feedback

Encouraging member participation and feedback is essential for the success of any Discord community. To foster engagement, server owners and moderators can create channels dedicated to different topics, events, or interests to encourage discussion and collaboration among members. They can also host regular events, such as Q&A sessions, jams, or game tournaments, to build a sense of community and keep members engaged. Moreover, it's important to actively seek feedback from members and listen to their suggestions and concerns. Server owners and moderators can create surveys or feedback forms to gather input on server rules, features, or community goals. By involving members in the community-building process and valuing their input, Discord servers can create a more inclusive and collaborative environment that benefits everyone. <br>

1.	Create channels dedicated to different topics, interests, or hobbies, and encourage members to share their experiences, insights, or ideas related to those topics. <br>
2.	Host regular events, such as game tournaments, jams, or Q&A sessions, and invite members to participate and share their opinions. <br>
3.	Use Discord's built-in polls and surveys to gather feedback on server features, rules, or community goals. <br>
4.	Encourage members to share their own content, such as artwork, music, or code and provide feedback and support. <br>
5.	Recognize and reward active and engaged members, such as by highlighting their contributions, featuring their content, or offering exclusive roles or privileges. <br>
6.	Collaborate with other Discord communities or online groups to organize joint events, share resources, or cross-promote each other. <br>
7.	Establish open communication channels with members, such as a feedback or suggestion box, where they can voice their concerns, questions, or suggestions privately. <br>
8.	Use analytics tools, such as Statbot, to track member activity, identify trends, and gain insights on what works and what doesn't in the server. <br>

By implementing these strategies and continuously seeking member feedback, server owners and moderators can create a more engaging and inclusive Discord community that reflects the needs and interests of its members.

## Moderation and Maintenance

### Establishing a moderation team and guidelines

Establishing a moderation team and guidelines is essential to maintaining a positive and healthy community environment. The moderation team should consist of a group of dedicated individuals who are committed to upholding the community's rules and guidelines. It is important to choose moderators who are knowledgeable about the community, experienced in conflict resolution, and able to remain impartial in difficult situations. <br>

To establish moderation guidelines, it is recommended to use an existing template as a starting point. we have created a comprehensive Moderation Guidelines document that covers topics such as handling disruptive behavior, enforcing rules consistently, and providing support to community members. This document can be accessed here: https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/process-docs-and-markdown/discord-moderation-guidelines.md and serves as a great starting point for any community looking to establish their own moderation guidelines. <br>

When establishing moderation guidelines, it is important to ensure that they are clear, concise, and easy to understand. It is also important to communicate the guidelines to the community so that everyone is aware of the rules and the consequences for breaking them. This can be done through a dedicated channel or section on the community website. <br>

The moderation team should also have a system in place for handling reports of rule violations. This can include a dedicated reporting channel or form, as well as guidelines for how moderators should handle reports. It is important to respond to reports in a timely manner and to follow up with the reporter to let them know that their concern has been addressed. <br>

In summary, establishing a moderation team and guidelines is crucial for maintaining a healthy and positive community environment. By choosing dedicated and knowledgeable moderators, creating clear and concise guidelines, and implementing a system for handling reports of rule violations, a community can create a safe and welcoming space for all members. And, as mentioned before, using an existing template such as the Moderation Guidelines created by the O3DE community can be a great starting point for any community looking to establish their own moderation guidelines. <br>

### Monitoring server activity and enforcing rules

For those interested in learning more about monitoring server activity and enforcing rules, there is a comprehensive guide available in the O3DE Community GitHub repository. This guide, called the Discord Moderation Guidelines, provides detailed information on how to monitor server activity, enforce rules, and handle rule violations. It also includes information on how to handle specific types of rule violations, such as harassment and hate speech. <br>

The Discord Moderation Guidelines can be accessed at the following link:  <br>https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/process-docs-and-markdown/discord-moderation-guidelines.md. This guide is an excellent resource for any community that is looking to establish a moderation team and ensure a safe and positive environment for all members.

### Regularly updating and improving the server based on member feedback and analytics

Regularly updating and improving the server is an essential part of maintaining a vibrant and engaged community. To do this, it is important to collect feedback from members and use analytics to identify areas for improvement. <br>

One way to collect feedback is by creating regular surveys or polls to ask members for their opinions on the server. This can include questions about the community guidelines, features they would like to see added, and any issues they may have encountered. <br>

Another way to gather feedback is by monitoring conversations and interactions on the server. This can help moderators identify areas where members may be struggling or experiencing issues, and allow them to address these issues proactively. <br>

Analytics can also be a valuable tool for improving the server. Discord offers built-in analytics that can provide information on server growth, member engagement, and activity levels. This data can be used to identify trends and patterns, and help moderators make informed decisions about how to improve the server. <br>

Once feedback and analytics have been collected, it is important to take action and implement changes based on this information. This can include updating the community guidelines, adding new features to the server, or adjusting moderation practices to better align with member needs. <br>

Regularly updating and improving the server not only helps to keep the community engaged, but also demonstrates a commitment to listening to member feedback and addressing their concerns. By using feedback and analytics to inform decisions, a community can create a more positive and engaging environment for all members. <br>

One useful tool for managing a large Discord community is [Statbot](https://statbot.net/). Statbot provides a range of analytics and moderation features that can help server owners and moderators track server activity, identify trends, and enforce server rules. Some of the key features of Statbot include real-time activity tracking, custom dashboard creation, moderation automation, and detailed reports on server growth and engagement. With these features, Statbot can help server owners and moderators stay on top of their community and make data-driven decisions to improve engagement and support among members. Additionally, Statbot integrates with a range of other Discord bots and tools, making it a versatile and powerful addition to any server management toolkit.
