## Headers 

```markdown
# This is an <h1> tag
  
## This is an <h2> tag 

### This is an <h3> tag   
  
#### This is an <h4> tag 
  
##### This is an <h5> tag
  
###### This is an <h6> tag
```

# This is an \<h1\> tag
  
## This is an \<h2\> tag 

### This is an \<h3\> tag   
  
#### This is an \<h4\> tag 
  
##### This is an \<h5\> tag
  
###### This is an \<h6\> tag
  
## Emphasis

```markdown
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

~~This text will be crossed out (strikethrough)~~ 

_You **can** combine them_

***All this text is bold and italic***
```

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

~~This text will be crossed out (strikethrough)~~ 

_You __can__ combine them_

***All this text is bold and italic***

## Lists

### Unordered

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

### Ordered

```markdown
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

## Images 

*Note if you are looking to link images, it is advised to create a folder in the readme location labeled "Media" or "Images". This will help prevent the image from vanishing if uploaded any other way.* 

If you are running a repository that runs LFS (Large File Support), then you may run into issues uploading and displaying images. If this is the case you will need to modify the repo on the host end (GitHub) to allow uploading of these images. 

Navigate to the ".gitattributes" file in the repo. Search for the files that you are using in the readme (Usually it will be png). Will look something like this

*.png filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

Copy and paste at the bottom of the text file including the file those images are stored in. For example;

Media/*.png filter= diff= merge= -text
or
Images/*.png filter= diff= merge= -text


```markdown
Format:  ![Alt Text](url)
Example: ![Newspaper Delivery Game](https://github.com/o3de/NewspaperDeliveryGame/blob/main/Media/image7.png)
```

If the image is located within folder tree that this readme is located in, you would then use the following:

```markdown
Format:  ![Alt Text](url)
Example: ![Newspaper Delivery Game](/Media/image01.png)
"Media" being the folder that your images are located in. 
```

![Newspaper Delivery Game](https://github.com/o3de/NewspaperDeliveryGame/blob/main/Media/image7.png)

## Links 

```markdown
http://github.com - automatic!
```

http://github.com - automatic!

```markdown
Format:  [Test](url)
Example: [GitHub](http://github.com)
```

[GitHub](http://github.com)

## Blockquotes

```markdown
As Bruce Banner said:

> That’s my secret, Captain.
> I’m always angry.
```

As Bruce Banner said:

> That’s my secret, Captain.
> I’m always angry.

Blockquotes can be nested.

```markdown
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

## Horizontal Rules

Horizontal rules can be created using three or more asterisks (\*\*\*), dashes (\-\-\-), or underscores (\_\_\_) on a line by themselves.

```markdown 
*** 
----
______
```

*** 
----
______

## Tables 

```markdown
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
```

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

```markdown
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |
```

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |

Your Markdown does't have to be pretty. 

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (`|`) are optional, and you don't need to make the table columns line up prettily.

```markdown
Less | Pretty | Markdown 
--- | --- | ---
1 | 2 | 3 
*Still* | `renders` | **as expected**
4 | 5 | 6
```

Less | Pretty | Markdown

## Blackslash escape

Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown’s formating syntax.

| Name                  | Markdown  | Result |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| backslash             | `\\`      | \\     |
| backtick              | `` \` ``  | \`     |
| asterisk              | `\*`      | \*     |
| underscore            | `\_`      | \_     |
| curly braces          | `\{\}`    | \{\}   |
| square brackets       | `\[\]`    | \[ \]  |
| parentheses           | `\(\)`    | \(\)   |
| hash mark             | `\#`      | \#     |
| plus sign             | `\+`      | \+     |
| minus sign (hyphen)   | `\-`      | \-     |
| dot                   | `\.`      | \.     |
| exclamation mark      | `\!`      | \!     |

## Task Lists

```
- [x] this is a complete item 
- [ ] this is an incomplete it
   - [ ] A subtask
```

- [x] this is a complete item 
- [ ] this is an incomplete it
   - [ ] A subtask

## Inline HTML

Markdown also supports raw HTML.

```html
<dl>
  <dt>First Term</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>
  <dt>Second Term</dt>
  <dd>This is one definition of the second term. </dd>
  <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>First Term</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>
  <dt>Second Term</dt>
  <dd>This is one definition of the second term. </dd>
  <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>
</dl>

```html
<p>Markdown in HTML does *not* work **well**. Use <i>HTML</i> <b>tags</b> instead.</p>
```

## Collapsible section


<details>
  <summary>Title 1</summary>
  <p>Content 1 Content 1 Content 1 Content 1 Content 1</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Title 2</summary>
  <p>Content 2 Content 2 Content 2 Content 2 Content 2</p>
</details>


```markdown
<details>
 <summary>Title 1</summary>
 <p>Content 1 Content 1 Content 1 Content 1 Content 1</p>
</details>
```  

## Link to the top of the page or a specific section on said page

[Go To TOP](#table-of-contents)
<a name="table-of-contents"></a>
   
```markdown
[Go To TOP](#table-of-contents)
<a name="table-of-contents"></a>
``` 

```markdown
[a Name](#Section-ID)
<a name="Section-ID></a>
```   
  

## Fenced Code Blocks

You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks ` ``` ` before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

To display triple backticks in a fenced code block, wrap them inside quadruple backticks.

````````
````
```
Look! You can see my backticks.
```
````
````````

````
```
Look! You can see my backticks.
```
````

## Syntax highlighting

You can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.

For example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:

````
```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
````

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

### No highlighting 

````markdown
```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
````

```
if (isAwesome) {
  return true
}
```

````
```markdown
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
````

```markdown
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

### Highlighting 

````markdown
```javascript 
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
````

```javascript
if (isAwesome) {
  return true
}
```

### JavaScript Syntax

````
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
````

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
### Python Syntax

````
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
````

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

### HTML Syntax
````
``` html
<p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;HTML Document&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre></p>
```
````

``` html
<p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;HTML Document&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre></p>
```
 
### No Langauage

````
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```
````

```

```

You can have list/line code sections as well. 

````
Title
----
- Line1
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  - Line2
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```
````

#### Title
----
- Line1
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  - Line2
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```

## Inline code

```markdown
I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.
```

I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.

Markdown coverts text with four leading spaces
into a code block; with GFM you can wrap your code
with 


## Emoji

Look up emoji codes at [emoji-cheat-sheet.com](http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)

```markdown
:+1: :sparkles: :camel: :tada: :rocket: :metal:
```

:+1: :sparkles: :camel: :tada: :rocket: :metal:

## Username @ mentions
Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will
notify that person to come and view the comment.
This is called an “@mention”, because you’re
mentioning the individual. You can also @mention
teams within an organization

## Issue References
Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request
will be automatically converted into a link. Note this issue has to be located from within the repository that you are doing your work in. 
#1


## Hotkey

<kbd>⌘F</kbd>

<kbd>⇧⌘F</kbd>

```markdown
<kbd>⌘F</kbd>
``` 

Hotkey list:

| Key | Symbol |
| --- | --- |
| Option | ⌥ |
| Control | ⌃ |
| Command | ⌘ |
| Shift | ⇧ |
| Caps Lock | ⇪ |
| Tab | ⇥ |
| Esc | ⎋ |
| Power | ⌽ |
| Return | ↩ |
| Delete | ⌫ |
| Up | ↑ |
| Down | ↓ |
| Left | ← |
| Right | → |


## Footnotes

Footnotes aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they supported by GFM.

```Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
```

## YouTube Videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```markdown
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
```

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

```markdown
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
