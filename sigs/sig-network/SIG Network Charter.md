**Overview of SIG**

Two concise lines explaining what this SIG does with bullet points of the major responsibilities

- Responsibility 1

**Goals**

- Major goals that SIG seeks to generally achieve

**Scope**

- Generalized overall scope of work

**In scope**
Define standard for communication negotiation.
Define and maintain implementation to enable compression and secure communication between endpoints
Define and implement interface to network counters, monitoring, and statistics
Define and implement low level instrumentation APIs

Network:
Design and maintain client and server protocol communication 
Define, publish, and maintain network protocol and data packet design model.
Responsible for network presence and state replication.
Create and Maintain network simulation tools for testing network condititons.

Design and maintain multiplayer component architecture supporting client hosted and dedicated server strategies
Define and maintain specific implementation of multiplayer controller component.

Cloud:
Design and implement network communication and data exchange for cloud services.
Define, standardize, and maintain interface to feature based cloud services.
Define and maintain code to enable cloud data services communication
Define and implement 3rd party distribution platform services interfaces.

for identity, matchmaking, profiles, persistence.

- Items that are the core responsibilities of SIG

**Cross-cutting Processes**
consume and utilize services
ensure client and server targets
Define communication protocol and stack
Define and maintain entity replication network model
Responsible for abstraction of console design for dedicated / headless server implementation (core / init)
Define and maintain implementation of communication and data transfer between network based tools.

Reponsible for design and implementation of controller component until matured and moved into simulation SIG.

Publish multiplayer component standard architecture to be shared with SIGs for remote simulation (physics/animation)

- Items that span or require other SIGs or groups and how it relates to this SIG’s responsibilities

**Out of Scope**
Not responsible for cloud or network services or interopability with such.
Not responsible for 3rd party gems and code for network services
Not responsible for best practices of network or services implementation.
Not responsible for the network tool implementation outside of core multiplayer and cloud services, but may advise teams on best practices.

- Items that are optional or are not the responsibility of this SIG.
