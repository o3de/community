# Contributing to the Community Repo

Welcome to the Open 3D Engine Community contributing guide. We are excited about the prospect of you joining our [community](https://github.com/o3de/community)!

There are many opportunities to contribute to the O3DE project at any level. Every contribution is highly valued and no contribution is too small.

You do not need to write code to contribute to this project. Tests, documentation, demos, and feature design advancements are a key part of this project's growth. One of the best ways to begin contributing in a meaningful way is by helping find bugs and filing issues for them.

## Getting Started

We have full documentation on how to get started contributing here:
- [O3DE Contributor Guide](https://o3de.org/docs/contributing/) - Main contributor documentation


This project has many different disciplines represented by special interest groups (SIGs). If you have a speciality, or just want to contribute to a certain area, please look through the SIGs and their respective charters here:

processes and roles. Please consider joining Open 3D Engine, and making your way
up the contributor ladder!

### Events

Open 3D Engine participates in O3DECon and related Industry events. Information about these and other community events is available on the O3DE [Event Calendar](https://lists.o3de.org/g/o3de-calendar/calendar) page.

### Meetups

All Open 3D Engine meetups follow the general [Cloud Native Computing Foundation Guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups)
You may also contact O3DE Staff driving the Community Groups program by email (meetups@o3de.org)
