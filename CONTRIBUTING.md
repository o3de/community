# Contributing to the Community Repo

Welcome to the Open 3D Engine Community contributing guide. We are excited about the prospect of you joining our [community](https://github.com/o3de/community)!

There are many opportunities to contribute to the O3DE project at any level. Every contribution is highly valued and no contribution is too small.

You do not need to write code to contribute to this project. Tests, documentation, demos, and feature design advancements are a key part of this project's growth. One of the best ways to begin contributing in a meaningful way is by helping find bugs and filing issues for them.

## Getting Started

We have full documentation on how to get started contributing here:

- [O3DE Contributor Guide](http://github.com/o3de/community/contributors/guide) - Main contributor documentation
- [Contributor Cheat Sheet](github.com/o3de/community/contributors/guide/contributor-cheatsheet/) - Common resources for existing developers
