"# O3DE SIG Features Editing tool" 

jump to [Feature State Form](https://o3de.github.io/community/features/form.html)

Please use this tool to create and update the feature list.
The SIG pulldown is loaded from here: https://github.com/o3de/community/tree/main/features/sigjson

You can select the SIG and it will populate the page. Alternatively, you can also choose a JSON file from your local drive, but it must match the proper format.

From there, you can create new subsystems and rows as well as download the JSON when you are done.

Subsystems should be larger categories like "Multiplayer, Core Networking, Cloud Services" or "Lighting, Render Hardware Interface, Shaders"
The Rows should be more specific to the feature that fits under that subsystem. Like "DirectX 12, Vulkan, Metal under Lighting subsystem"

when you make changes and want to save it in github, you can create a pull request from the community repo against the files listed above.
Once accepted and merges, your changes should appear on the github.io page in about 5-10 minutes.

The results of these files will be used as formatted tabled that will serve as artifacts in the release builds so that developers that want to use the engine can easily see the maturity of the features and subsystems of the engine.

If you have suggestions or want to work on the code, let someone know or reach out to me OBWANDO (Royal OBrien) on github or Discord.
